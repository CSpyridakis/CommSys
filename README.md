This repository contains code and report files of Labs implemented for a <i>Communication Systems</i> Course at the Technical University of Crete. During this course, 3 Labs were carried out, with specific learning objectives for everyone.

### Learning objectives

#### [Lab 1](./Lab-1/):
In the first lab, we had to create SRRC pulses for different values of roll-off factor a, compute Fourier Transform for each case, based on that, calculate the Theoretical and Practical Bandwidth. Then, prove the Nyquist ISI criterion for SRRC pulses. Finally, create a baseband 2-PAM Communication System without Noise existence.

#### [Lab 2](./Lab-2/):
In the first portion of the second lab, we had to use our knowledge about SRRC pulses from the first lab to create N-PAM baseband waveforms and do a spectrum analysis on them for different values of N and T (period). The purpose of this lab is to understand the dissimilarities of each waveform and how to choose designing parameters based on requirements.

#### [Lab 3](./Lab-3/):
In the third lab, we had to make a complete 16-QAM simulation - with Noise existence - of a passband communication system, with the assumption of having an ideal channel and using two independent 4-PAM waveforms to implement this.

### Documentation
If you want more information about each lab you could read (or just try to read, unfortunately at this point are only in greek language) the following report files:

1. [Lab 1 - Report](./Lab-1/doc/Communication_Systems_1_Exercise_1.pdf)
2. [Lab 2 - Report](./Lab-2/doc/Communication_Systems_1_Exercise_2.pdf)
3. [Lab 3 - Report](./Lab-3/doc/Communication_Systems_1_Exercise_3.pdf)

### Code
Moreover, code created for these labs is available here:

1. [Lab 1](./Lab-1/src)
2. [Lab 2](./Lab-2/src)
2. [Lab 3](./Lab-3/src)

### Enviroment
* Code: This project was developed using [Matlab R2014b](https://mathworks.com)
* Reports: Report files are written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
