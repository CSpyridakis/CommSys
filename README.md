This repository contains code and reports files of Labs implemented for a <i>Communication Systems</i> Course at the Technical University of Crete. During this course, 3 Labs were carried out with specific learning objectives for each.

### Learning objectives
#### [Lab 1](./Lab-1)
In the [first lab](./Lab-1/),  we have to create SRRC pulses for different values of roll-off factor a, create Fourier Transform for each case and based on that calculate the Theoretical and Practical Bandwidth. Then, prove the Nyquist ISI criterion for SRRC pulses. Finally, create a basic 2-PAM Communication System without Noise existence.

### Documentation
If you want more information about each lab you could read (or just try to read, unfortunately at this point are only in greek language) the following report files:

1. [Lab 1 - Report](./Lab-1/doc/Communication_Systems_1_Exercise_1.pdf)
2. [Lab 2 - Report](./Lab-2/doc/Communication_Systems_1_Exercise_2.pdf)

### Code
Moreover, code created for these labs is available here:

1. [Lab 1](./Lab-1/src)
2. [Lab 2](./Lab-2/src)

### Enviroment
* Code: This project was developed using [Matlab R2014b](https://mathworks.com)
* Repors: Report files are written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
