Code created for labs of <i>Communication Systems I</i> Course in Technical University of Crete

## Labs
* In the [first lab](./Lab-1/) we have to create SRRC pulses for different values of roll-off factor a, find out Fourier Transform for each case and based on that calculate the Theoretical and Practical Bandwidth. Then, prove Nyquist ISI criterion for SRRC pulses. Finally, create a basic 2-PAM Communication System without Noise existence.
