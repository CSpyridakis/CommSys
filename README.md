Code created for labs of <i>Communication Systems I</i> Course in Technical University of Crete

## Labs
### Lab 1
In the [first lab](./Lab-1/)  we have to create SRRC pulses for different values of roll-off factor a, create Fourier Transform for each case and based on that calculate the Theoretical and Practical Bandwidth. Then, prove Nyquist ISI criterion for SRRC pulses. Finally, create a basic 2-PAM Communication System without Noise existence.

If you want more information, you could read (or just try to read, unfortunately at this point is only in greek language) the following report: [Report 1](./Lab-1/doc/Communication_Systems_1_Exercise_1.pdf)

[Source files](./Lab-1/src/) created in Matlab.
